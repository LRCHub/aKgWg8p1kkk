# Little Dragon – Tumbling Dice

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I'll be gone in a flash,
let's dance till we go
One day all of us
will be buried in stone
Take a breath, make it worth
every step as we go
Tumbling in the wind
Soaking in all the light,
follow it, traveling
Plant a seed, climb a tree
to the tip of a dream
Foolish how I believe
I'm immortal
Tumbling in the wind
In the end, may we lie
with a lingering smile
For those beautiful times,
uh-huh
In the end,
if we cry for forgiveness
Let's die for
those beautiful times, mmm-hmm
You'll be gone in a flash,
let's dance till we go
Taking in every chance,
let's dance real slow
How I long for a life
next to you
Tumbling in the wind (Tumbling)
In the end, may we lie
with a lingering smile
For those beautiful times,
mmm-hmm
In the end,
if we cry for forgiveness
Let's die for
those beautiful times, ooh, ooh
