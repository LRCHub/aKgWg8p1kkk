Women think I'm tasty, always tryin' to waste me
Make me burn the candle right down, but baby, baby
I don't need no jewels in my crown

It's all you women is low down gamblers
Cheatin' like I don't know how, but baby, baby
There's fever in the funk house now

This low down a bitchin' got my poor feet a itchin'
Don't you know the deuce is still wild
Baby, I can't stay, you got to roll me
And call me the tumbling dice

Always in a hurry, never stop to worry
Don't see the time flashin' by
Honey, got no money
I'm all sixes and sevens, and nines

Say now baby, I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime
Well baby, I can't stay you got to roll me
And call me the tumbling dice, call me the tumbling dice

Oh, my, my, my, I'm the lone crap shooter
Playin' the field every night
Baby, I can't stay, you got to roll me
And call me the tumbling dice, call me the tumbling dice

Call me the tumbling dice, call me the tumbling dice
Call me the tumbling dice, call me the tumbling dice
Call me the tumbling dice, call me the tumbling dice
Call me the tumbling dice, call me the tumbling dice
